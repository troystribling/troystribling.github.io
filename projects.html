        Agent XMPP is the first Ruby application framework for writing automated XMPP clients that support Messaging, Ad-Hoc Commands and Publish Subscribe Events.
        Out of the box you get authentication, authorization, contacts and management statistics. Applications can be written with just a few lines of code.

      <p>
        zgomot is a Ruby DSL for composing music as programs. Programs generate MIDI streams that are rendered by audio software such as GarageBand and Ableton Live.
        It provides abstractions that easily allow programming of algorithmic music. This includes using Roman Numeral Notation to represent a melody and applying
        sequences of transformations to produce notes.
