      <p>
        zgomot is a Ruby DSL for composing music as programs. Programs generate MIDI streams that are rendered by audio software such as GarageBand and Ableton Live.
        It provides abstractions that easily allow programming of algorithmic music. This includes using Roman Numeral Notation to represent a melody and applying
        sequences of transformations to produce notes.
