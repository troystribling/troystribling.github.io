        BlueCap provides a swift wrapper around Core Bluetooth and the following additionally functionality. A DSL for specification of GATT profiles. Bluetooth LE device manufactures can provide implementations of their GATT profiles for distribution to developers and developers can easily implement GATT profiles for their Bluetooth LE devices. Connectorators and scannerators provide management of peripheral scan and connection events such as timeouts, disconnect and connect and finally, a futures based asynchronous interface for peripheral, service and characteristic discovery, characteristic read and write and characteristic value update notifications.

        BlueCap is an iOS app that provides Central and Peripheral Bluetooth LE functions and implementations of some BLESIG profiles and profiles for the TiSensorTag. The supported functionality includes a scanner for Bluetooth LE peripherals that can be configured to scan promiscuously or for specified services. It will recognize if the peripheral provides services using included GATT profiles and correctly serialize and deserialize data.  In peripheral mode BlueCap can emulate any of the included GATT profiles or an iBeacon. In iBeacon ranging mode beacon regions can be configured and monitored.

        Agent XMPP is the first Ruby application framework for writing automated XMPP clients that support Messaging, Ad-Hoc Commands and Publish Subscribe Events.
        Out of the box you get authentication, authorization, contacts and management statistics. Applications can be written with just a few lines of code.

        zgomot is a Ruby DSL for composing music as programs. Programs generate MIDI streams that are rendered by audio software such as GarageBand and Ableton Live.
        It provides abstractions that easily allow programming of algorithmic music. This includes using Roman Numeral Notation to represent a melody and applying
        sequences of transformations to produce notes.
